A new way for encryption

When I was showering I had a scenario that I'm the government's hacker in a foreign country. 
I had to use some kind of encryption. But if they catch me, they can torture me for password. The problem here is, I'm not a soldier, I can't stand the torture for a long time. 
Or they can just brute-force it for years with the supercomputers.

So I got an idea. 
Think about Keymaker in the Matrix movie. 
If he opens a door with a specific key, that door leads to a different part of the Matrix. If he opens the same door with a different key he will end up somewhere else.

The Keymaker program is basically the same idea.
Here an example:
"dummy.zip" is a compressed zip file but It has two different passwords.
If you open it with the easy password (123123), It will extract few fake-government secrets.
And brute-force programs probably find this password first. 
But if you open it with the relativetly complex password(7Mp5bacIC-&'2P$sE5UjWgRQN5Jg.n;A), It will show the real government secrets.

Usage:
 kmgn 'dummy_file_path' 'actual_file_path' 'dummy_password' 'actual_password' 'destination_folder_path' compresslevel(0-9)
 
 
To get actual file:
 kmgn 'pathtofile'
